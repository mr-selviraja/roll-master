# Roll Master - A Dice Game App

## Description

Roll Master is a simple and interactive dice game app built as part of learning JQuery and JS OOPs.
- It's a game between two players i.e., Player1 and Player2.
- Players wins either on the basis of number of rolls done (or) score obtained by the Player.
- Players can manually set either max score to win (or) max rolls to decide the winner.
- A new game can be started with just a click of "New Game" button.
- UI can be toggled between the light and dark themes.

Roll Master can be a simple game for kids and children to have some fun. Web APIs like Browser DOM 
were used in the app making process.
